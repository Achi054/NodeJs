# NodeJs
NodeJs or Node is a open source, cross platform runtime environment for running Javascript code. Quite often we use Node to compose backend services to be exposed as APIs. <br/>
Node is usually build to create highly scalable, data intensive and real time application.

## Advantages
- Great for prototyping and agile development
- Highly scalable services
- Node uses Javacscript framework
- Cleaner and consistent codebase
- Large eco-system of open source libraries

## Runtime environment
Browser uses Javascript engine to run Javascript code in browser. <br/>
NodeJs = Googles V8 Javascript engine wrapped around with c++ code.<br/>
Node is not a programming language or framework, its just a runtime engine. <br/>

## How it works
Node application are asyncronous by default. <b>Non blocking asynchronous.</b><br/>
Node use one thread to handle multiple requests. It processes a requests in background and continues to process the next request. The state of background request is maintained in a <b>Event Queue</b>.

## Installation of NodeJs
- Find if Node is already installed<br/>
